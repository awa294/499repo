Final Project for CS371: Introduction to Networks - Spring 2019


Clone Scapy Repository in order to run programs from this repository. https://github.com/secdev/scapy 
*If you are able to successfully pip installs scapy then that is probably easier but that hasn't worked for me*

For linux, follow instructions to install pip from https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04/ 

use pip3 (or whatever version you choose to download) to install numpy and pandas libraries.
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
